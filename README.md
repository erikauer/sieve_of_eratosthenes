# sieve_of_eratosthenes
Python Implementation of the sieve of eratosthenes

# Run

Clone the code to your local machine by using

     git clone https://github.com/erikauer/sieve_of_eratosthenes.git
     
Go inside the project root directory and run the script

     python sieveoferatosthenes.py
     
# Change boundary

The algorithm calculates all primes until to a specific boundary value. You can change the boundary value by changing the 
line of code inside the sieveoferatosthenes.py file. E.g you can change following line

     boundary = 5000;

to display all primes between 0 and 5000.
